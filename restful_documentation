What is OpenAPI:
Open API Specification (or OAS) is a language-dependent standard that visualizes/describes RESTful API behavior. It usually creates a file containing API documentation so those who use the API won't have to analyse the whole source code and can rely on the documentation.

As mentioned, OpenAPI is a global format to gather some information about the API service, including:
- what is each request receiving and how it should be sent
- what is each response sending and how it sends data to clients
- how the authentication/authorization process works in a service
- contact info, terms of use, licenses etc.


What is Swagger:
Swagger is basically an IDL (Interface Description Language) that is used as a tool to describe API services clearly to clients for better use of the API. Swagger documentation is written in files formatted with YAML or JSON. There are various third-party packages to create readable/useful Swagger documentation for RESTful APIssuch as Swagger UI. For Django, we have options like django-rest-swagger, drf-spectacular, drf-yasg etc.


What is Swagger UI:
Swagger UI is a tool for generating RESTful API documentation based on Open API 3 schema.


What is drf-spectacular:
drf-spectacular is a DRF library that generates Open API 3 schema API documentation for Django-Rest Framework.

What is drf-yasg:
